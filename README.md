The goal of this book was to provide the reader with everything someone needs to know to start a new tech business.

## Intended audience

When I started writing, I intended the audience to be adults, however, over time it became clear the audience of this book should be young adults of middle- or high-school age.

That said, some of the language and content used is still targeting adults and could use some cleaning up to make it better target its intended audience.

## Publishing on the web

I originally intended to publish a real paper book, but it became clear to me that wasn't the right format for the content.  Even an ebook is a poor fit.

For that reason, I settled on publishing to a website, where it can constantly be updated and improved upon.

## A living document

This book is a living document.  Its content will change over time with fixes, improvements, or entirely new sections.
